# cityfm-product-list

A simple products page for customers to view product details. Since the API site given in the question was not accessible, the way I went about it is:
1. Creating a json file with product data.
2. Accessing and reading that file in the backend.
3. Calculating the mark up price in the backend.
4. Using the frontend to fetch data from the backend.
5. Diplaying the data on the frontend.

Hopefully I've answered the question well. Thanks!
